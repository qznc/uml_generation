# PSE UML Design

This repository provides an exemplary set of tools for the PSE design phase.

It assumes you run Ubuntu and are fine with editing Makefiles etc.
It also requires graphviz and javadoc.

## The Lambda Example

The file `Lambda.java` contains our design.
In theory, it is possible to use multiple files,
but we have not figured out how to do that reliably.

You can `make Lambda.png` to generate a UML class diagram of the whole model.

You can `make docs.tex` to generate a tex file with your JavaDoc documentation.
